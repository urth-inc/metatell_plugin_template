## Tips

### Restrictions

- Do not use default export. export Component as named export
- Component name should be `AdditionalToolbarButton`
- component should be placed in `src/AdditionalToolbarButton` directory
  - You can change the directory to update federation config in `/configs/federationConfig.js`

### Styling

You can use CSS Modules without any additional configuration.

If you want to use different styling systems like styled-components, you can do so by installing the required packages.

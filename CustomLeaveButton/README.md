# CustomLeaveButton template

## Description

This is a template for creating a CustomLeaveButton for `metatell`.

`metatell` has a built-in leave button feature that opens a modal when the user clicks the leave button. The leave button is located at the second right side of the toolbar.
The default leave button looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/toolbar.png" alt="default leave button" />
</p>

When the leave button is clicked, the leave modal is displayed:
Default leave modal looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/leave-modal.png" alt="default leave modal" />
</p>

You can replace the default leave button and modal with a custom one by creating a CustomChatButton.

## Interface

The custom leave button should implement the following interface:

```ts
interface CustomLeaveButtonProps {
  showDefaultModal: () => void;
  destinationUrl: string;
}
```

- `showDefaultModal`: A function that opens the metatell's default leave modal. If you want to use custom leave modal, you don't need to use this function.

## Tips

### Restrictions

- do not use default export. export Component as named export
- component name should be `CustomLeaveButton`
- component should be placed in `src/CustomLeaveButton` directory
  - You can change the directory to update federation config in `/configs/federationConfig.js`

### Styling

You can use CSS Modules without any additional configuration.

If you want to use different styling systems like styled-components, you can do so by installing the required packages.

# CustomMegaphoneButton template

## Description

This is a template for creating a CustomMegaphoneButton for `metatell`.

`metatell` has a built-in megaphone button feature that allows users to use megaphone.

You can replace the default megaphone button a custom one by creating a CustomChatButton.

## Interfaces

The CustomMegaphoneButton should implement the following interface:

```ts
interface CustomMegaphoneButtonProps {
  canMegaphone: boolean;
  temporalMegaphone: boolean;
  isActiveMegaphone: boolean;
  muteMegaphone: () => Promise<void>;
  unmuteMegaphone: () => Promise<void>;
  mySessionId: string | undefined;
  messageDispatch: EventTarget;
  requestMegaphone: () => void;
  grantMegaphone: () => Promise<void>;
  revokeMegaphone: () => Promise<void>;
  approveMegaphoneRequest: (sessionId: string) => void;
}
```

- canMegaphone: A boolean value that indicates whether the user has a megaphone permission or not.
- temporalMegaphone: A boolean value that indicates whether the user has a temporal megaphone permission or not.
- isActiveMegaphone: A boolean value that indicates whether the user is using a megaphone or not.
- muteMegaphone: A function that mutes the megaphone. If canMegaphone is false and temporalMegaphone is false, this function should not be called.
- unmuteMegaphone: A function that unmutes the megaphone. If canMegaphone is false and temporalMegaphone is false, this function should not be called.
- mySessionId: A string value that represents the user's session ID.
- messageDispatch: An EventTarget object that is used to dispatch messages. You can use this object to handle megaphone-related events.
- requestMegaphone: A function that requests a temporal megaphone permission.
- grantMegaphone: A function that grants a temporal megaphone permission. If you call this function, you will have a temporal megaphone permission.
- revokeMegaphone: A function that revokes a temporal megaphone permission. If you call this function, you will lose a temporal megaphone permission.
- approveMegaphoneRequest: A function that approves a megaphone request.

## Tips

### Restrictions

- do not use default export. export Component as named export
- component name should be `CustomMegaphoneButton`
- component should be placed in `src/CustomMegaphoneButton` directory
  - You can change the directory by updating federation config in `/configs/federationConfig.js`

### Styling

You can use CSS Modules without any additional configuration.

If you want to use different styling systems like styled-components, you can do so by installing the required packages.
